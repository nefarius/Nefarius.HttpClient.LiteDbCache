Adds disk-based response caching to HttpClient named instances using LiteDB.

Work in progress... üî•

## Motivation

Sometimes a response from a remote HTTP service doesn't change frequently and fetching it again multiple times within a
certain time span is wasteful and puts unnecessary delays on the caller. Offline caching to the rescue! However,
manually storing and fetching responses gets verbose and complex fast, why not hide that complexity away and
let `IHttpClientFactory` deal with it behind the scenes?

This library provides the extension method `AddLiteDbCache` you can chain your named HTTP client call with and specify
an embedded database location to use for offline caching, no other code changes are required.

### Why not use [`IMemoryCache`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/performance/caching/memory)?

The goal of the cache is to survive application/service restarts.

### Why not use [`IDistributedCache`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/performance/caching/distributed)?

This library is aimed at end-user clients where you wish to drag in as little dependency on 3rd party services as
possible. An embedded database sitting in some folder does the trick there perfectly.

## Features

- Each named HTTP client gets its own backing cache database instance which is kept exclusively open by default
  throughout application lifetime for performance benefits.
- Cached entries expiration (and exclusion) can be configured globally per named instance.

## How to use

Register one or
more [named HTTP clients](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/http-requests#named-clients)
with `AddLiteDbCache`. This example snippet registers a cached client that will query your public IP address
using [`https://ifconfig.me/`](https://ifconfig.me/) and cache the response indefinitely to a local embedded database
instance:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddHttpClient("ifconfig", cfg =>
{
    cfg.BaseAddress = new Uri("https://ifconfig.me");
    
}).AddLiteDbCache(options =>
{
    // note: ensure that the path given already exists or you'll get a runtime exception
    options.ConnectionString = @"C:\Temp\ifconfig.db";
    options.CollectionName = "ifconfig-response-cache";
    options.EntryOptions.AbsoluteExpirationRelativeToNow = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(10);
});
```

This cached named client can now be consumed like any other `HttpClient` wherever needed:

```csharp
HttpClient client = _clientFactory.CreateClient("ifconfig");

HttpResponseMessage result = await client.GetAsync("/", ct);

string? publicIP = await result.Content.ReadAsStringAsync(ct);
```

If a cached entry exists, the response (headers, body content etc.) will be pulled and returned from the local database
and no remote web request will be issued until the cache entry expires.
