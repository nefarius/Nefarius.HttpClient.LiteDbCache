Adds disk-based response caching to HttpClient named instances using LiteDB.

Work in progress... üî•

## Motivation

Sometimes a response from a remote HTTP service doesn't change frequently and fetching it again multiple times within a
certain time span is wasteful and puts unnecessary delays on the caller. Offline caching to the rescue! However,
manually storing and fetching responses gets verbose and complex fast, why not hide that complexity away and
let `IHttpClientFactory` deal with it behind the scenes?

This library provides the extension method `AddLiteDbCache` you can chain your named HTTP client call with and specify
an embedded database location to use for offline caching, no other code changes are required.

## How to use

Register one or
more [named HTTP clients](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/http-requests#named-clients)
with `AddLiteDbCache`. This example snippet registers a cached client that will query your public IP address
using [`https://ifconfig.me/`](https://ifconfig.me/) and cache the response indefinitely to a local embedded database
instance:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddHttpClient("ifconfig", cfg =>
{
    cfg.BaseAddress = new Uri("https://ifconfig.me");
    
}).AddLiteDbCache(options =>
{
    options.ConnectionString = @"C:\Temp\ifconfig.db";
    options.CollectionName = "ifconfig-response-cache";
    options.EntryOptions.AbsoluteExpirationRelativeToNow = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(10);
});
```

This cached named client can now be consumed like any other `HttpClient` wherever needed:

```csharp
HttpClient client = _clientFactory.CreateClient("ifconfig");

HttpResponseMessage result = await client.GetAsync("/", ct);

string? publicIP = await result.Content.ReadAsStringAsync(ct);
```

If a cached entry exists, the response (headers, body content etc.) will be pulled and returned from the local database
and no remote web request will be issued until the cache entry expires.
